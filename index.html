<h1>COMP110 Project: Crappy Undertale</h1>
<p>The objective of this project was to create a game(using Undertale, a video game, graphics as a skin). The game's basic functionality was for the player to control a heart with the arrow keys and dodge oncoming enemies of random sizes that appear at the top of the screen and drop down. Eventually, more and more functionalities were added to the game. Each enemy you dodge will add one to a visible score counter, and the enemies get progressively faster and faster as the game goes on. Also, two types of powerups will drop in the form of cellphones with each having a different color in them. The yellow cellphone will turn the player yellow and flip them upside down, and give them a notification that they can press z to shoot. Shooting enemies will push them off the top of the screen and award the player bonus points. The purple cellphone will turn the player small and purple, allowing them to manuver through enemies more easily. Upon colliding with an enemy, whichever color heart the player has will appear as broken at the spot they died, and a message saying "sorry bud, you died. But your score was <score>." A try again button is below these messages, and if pressed the game reboots from the beginning.</p>
<p>I worked on this game alone, with help of TAs at HACK 110.</p>
<p>Almost if not all of COMP110 programming concepts were used in this project. JavaFX key//mouse events were used to program the player moving with the arrow keys and for the game to reboot if the try again button is pressed. All enemies and bullets on the screen are stored in sets so they could be easily added, modified, and removed throughout the game. The Character, Enemies, and Bullets all had their own classes, with the Enemies having a long constructor that randomizes them. Each class had getter and setter methods related to position, height/width, and powerups. Many loops and if then statements were used throughout, usually to signify if the player has a powerup or has lost the game. For each loops were used to go through the enemies and bullet sets and do various things, like checking if they were offscreen to delete them, or to see if they were colliding with the character to signify a game over.</p>
<p>Two main new concepts allowed for the creation of this game. The first was GraphicsContext. GraphicsContext allowed for the game to draw images of various sizes. Every item in the game, including the text, was drawn with GraphicsContext. The second essential new concept was an Animation Timer. The animation timer essentially loops through itself many many times per second to update the player with what is actually happening. For events that need happen a bit slower, a slower timer can be set inside the main one through use of a _last field. This slower timer is used to spawn enemies, time powerups, and count score. The main timer was used to draw the Character, enemies, and bullets moving around the screen to appear fluid. if-then statements inside the animation timer are effectively while loops and were used as such.  </p>
<p><a href="Video Demonstration">https://youtu.be/0ccVMkTQ5y8</a> (the game lags a little bit due to the recording software)</p>
<p>Since the main goal of the basic game(not including a score timer, replay button, accelerating enemies,  and powerups) was acheived at HACK110, the goals of powerups and such were eventually reached over the next couple of days/</p>
<p>Future work on the game is definitely planned. More powerups will be added, along with possble "un-powerups" such as only allowing the player to move left to right for a certain time period. With a better understanding of changing Scenes, A start screen will be added with difficulty options. Difficulties will increase frequency and size of enemies, rate of acceleration, and frequency of powerups. A big thing I would really like to add to the game would be sounds. Sound effects would play when powerups are obtained, when bullets are fired, when enemies collide with those bullets, and when the player collides with an enemy. Optimally, each game would play a random song from Undertale, with the game over song playing once the player loses.  </p>
